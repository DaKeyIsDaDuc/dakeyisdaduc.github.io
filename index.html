      <h1>Basra</h1>
      <p>By 680 CE, this city lying on the coast of the Persian Gulf already had a sizable migrant population, although the oppression of this minority coupled with inter-sect struggles made this port a city of conflict. This city was regularly ravaged by insurrection and rebellion, such as the early Battle of the Camel, a battle that finalized the schism between Sunni and Shi’a Muslims due to the capturing of Ali, the Zanj rebellion, a slave uprising organized by African laborers brought into the country to assist in agriculture, and the devastation sustained from the invasion of the Qarmatians, an extremist religious sect. In its heyday, Basra was a home for Islamic learning, literature, and philosophy, in addition to being a transshipment port for sending goods to the capital of the Abbasids, Baghdad. </p>

      <h1>Cities of China</h1>
      <h2>Guangzhou</h2>
      <p>Guangzhou was a trading port serving various Chinese kingdoms and empires, starting with the Wu, although it reached its peak during the time of the early Song. This city was often the first place where new ideas and goods entered China, with many Hindu, Muslim, and Buddhist traders setting anchor there. During the later Song, it was gradually supplanted by Quanzhou as the empire’s primary port. </p>
      <h2>Quanzhou</h2>
      <p>Quanzhou was a more northern Chinese port during the Medieval period. During the Song dynasty, it was utilized for oceangoing shipbuilding, which allowed the Chinese to rival and depose the monopoly of Arab traders on Indian Ocean trade routes. During the Yuan dynasty, this port was known even to the likes of Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta, who lived half the world away. </p>
